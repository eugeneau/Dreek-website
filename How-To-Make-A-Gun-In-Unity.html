<h1>How to Make a Gun in Unity 2019.3.9f1</h1>
<h2>Let's Get Started!</h2>
1. Start by making a gun 3d model, then import it into Unity. Import the standard assets and drag and drop the player controller into the scene, or make your own player FPS controller. If you are making a shooter game, put the gun model as a child of the player camera.
2. Make a bullet prefab: for the sake of this tutorial, make a sphere, resize it appropriately and reset the Transform component. Drag and drop the object from your hierarchy into the project window to make a prefab. You can now delete the bullet from the scene. Make sure to save your changes (CTRL + S).
