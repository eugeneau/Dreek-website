<p>Hello, my name is CENSORED, but you probably know me as Dreek or Dreep. I am a Christian Unity developer, & I love making video games with Unity and C#. I have made a few Unity tutorials and 3d models on this website as well, so don't forget to check them out. Also, don't forget to check out my contact links below.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Pickles. You may know me as the news reporter for Jelopolous Weekly. I am Dreep's friend and I own an etsy shop, draw some of the art, and write the news stories on dreek16designer.com. Dreep does most of the coding and programming, but I know a tiny bit of html. :3</p>
