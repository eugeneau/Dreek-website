<p>Hi, I'm Dreek. I make Minecraft videos, go check them out! I like to program and have a Minecraft server, Dreek16Craft (mc.dreek16designer.com:26658) and I'm currently building a city.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Pickles. You may recognize me as the news reporter for Jelopolous Weekly. I am Dreek's friend and I draw some of the art and write the news stories on dreek16designer.com. Dreek does most of the coding and programming, but I know a tiny bit of html. :3</p>
