<p>Hello, I'm Dreek. I make Minecraft videos, go check them out! I like to program and have a Minecraft server called Dreek16Craft <br/>(mc.dreek16designer.com:25612) where I'm currently building a city.</p>
<p>Here's a photo of me:</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Pickles. I live in Panada, and my favourite creature that has been discovered thus far is the pou. You may recognize me <br/>as the news reporter for Jelopolous Weekly. I am Dreek's friend and I draw some of the art and write the news stories on dreek16designer.com. Dreek does most of the coding and programming, but I know a tiny bit of html. :3</p>
<p>Below is a picture of me!</p>
