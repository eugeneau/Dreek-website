    <h1>About Us</h1>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<p>Hello, I'm Dreek. I make Minecraft videos, you can go check them out! I like to program Unity games and play on my Minecraft server called MemeCraft. It is mainly survival, PVP, and creative. I'm currently building a RPG minigame map. Pickles, my friend, is really good at drawing and writing for the Jelopolous page.</p>
<p>Here's a photo of me:</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Pickles. I live in Panada, and my favourite creature that has been discovered thus far is the pou. You may recognize me <br/>as the news reporter for Jelopolous Weekly. I am Dreek's friend and I draw some of the art and write the news stories on dreek16designer.com. Dreek does most of the coding and programming, but I know a tiny bit of html. :3</p>
<p>Below is a picture of me!</p>
