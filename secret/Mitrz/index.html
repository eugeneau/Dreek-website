 <h2>BUHNNS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Booga boogaga. </p>
 <p> Although they may look harmless, the colourful and box-like buhnn is a very aggressive creature. Trust me, they are sooooooo agressive. üò≤. At the bottom of the buhnn's cube body, a robust, purple spring made of keratin is attached. Buhnns are red in colour and have glowing yellow eyes. Male buhnns have long, razor-sharp, green horns adorning their boxy heads, and females have short, dull stubs. They attack their prey by stealthily bouncing up to them from behind and then leaping atop their heads,  crushing their bodies. The buhnn's diet consists mainly of red meat. They particularly enjoy steak. Buhnns consume their food by swallowing it whole. Here's a picture of a red buhnn.</p>

 <h2>POUS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Mus Ponchus </p>
 <p> Commonly kept as pets, pous are relatively friendly and harmless. Most pous have short, brown fur, but there is a rare breed of pou called a golden pou that has long, curly, golden-brown fur. Golden pous are highly prized and it is estimated that only 350 golden pous reside in Jelopolous. The regular diet of a pou includes various seeds and fruits, as well as peanuts. However, the foods a pou desires most are black jelly beans and chili cheese dogs. Unfortunately for them, both of these foods are extremely unhealthy for them, so they can only have a small amount at a time. Pous are also very vocal and sociable animals, and when left alone for more than a few hours they start to squeal and shriek very loudly. These cries are so high pitched that they can shatter glass, and they are estimated to be as loud as 230 db. Pous are loud and yell, "POU, POU, POU!" when tickled. Here's a photo.</p>

 <h2>HAIHGS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Haihgo sapiens. </p>
 <p> With ash-gray skin and black, empty eyes, haihgs are quite frightening. It is said that the appearance of a haihg can make a grown man urinate his trousers in fear. Haihgs have long, bony talons, as well as fleshy, bulbous noses. They have puckered mouths with cracked, gray lips. The most well-known feature of a haihg, though, is its long, string, hair. Haihgs are nearly bald, save for a few of those thick, coarse hairs. They cascade down their bony shoulders and end with a comical curl. They are always hungry, and can consume up to 20 hippos per day. Despite gobbling up so much food daily, haihgs are extremely frail and lanky. Bones stick out of their elbows when they bend them, and their cheekbones are so sunken in that their eyes bulge, making them all the more frightening. Haihgs are also very clever and arrogant creatures. They are most proud of their hairy, broad feet, which are coated with grime and dust. They often boast of their feet to other haihgs. However, nobody can actually see their feet, because they are always covered by the bottom of the haihg's cloak. Below is a photo of an aggravated haihg.</p>

 <h2>FROUNNS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Clownus creepius </p>
 <p> Similar to clowns, frounns wear makeup and colourful costumes. Electric-blue curls frame their chubby, white faces. They are very jolly and have a loud, contagious laugh. Contrary to popular belief, frounns are actually very friendly and kind, handing out balloons to small children at their stands daily. Unfortunately, the children often do not accept the balloons and run away, screaming and crying. This is why frounns are quite poor and do not eat much, except for the foods that they get for free at the fair. As a result of this, frounns often ingest a large amount of pink cotton candy and yellow popcorn every day, making them quite large and heavy. Legend has it that if you give a frounn green cotton candy, they will melt into the floor in horror and disintegrate. Frounns are also very talented at playing instruments such as drums, saxophone, trumpet and flute. </p>

 <h2 id="chumm">CHUMMS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Ichthyus friendlius. </p>
 <p> Known for their unicorn horns and friendly behavior, chumms are one of Jelopolous‚Äôs most loved fish. They have pale blue scales covering their 2 cm long bodies, but their bellies are covered with short, white fur. This fur protects them when they are swimming at the bottom of the vast ocean to look for plants to eat. Chumms love seaweed and algae, but are partial to cottage cheese, as well as honey cruller donuts. The unicorn horn on top of their heads allow them to swim to the surface and skewer donuts that fall into the ocean. It also shimmers when night falls and provides a small light source for the chumm if it needs it in the deep, dark ocean. </p>

 <h2>MACCOS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Giantus Ronius. </p>
 <p> As their name suggests, these hefty giants will die for macaroni and cheese. Consuming so much of this fattening comfort food has caused many maccos to become morbidly obese, some weighing as much as 3000 pounds. A little-known fact about maccos is that they actually cannot smell. What many people assume to be a nose on this giant‚Äôs face is, in reality, only a thick flap of skin. This flap is made solely of fatty tissue, and if maccos were slim they would not have the flap, but skinny maccos do not exist. Maccos also have bad eyesight, considering that their beady eyes are about the size of peas. Since maccos have poor sight and no sense of smell, they have an especially strong sense of taste. Maccos are cheese connoisseurs, and if given Cap Dinner, they will ralph on it. </p>
 <h2 id="gris">GRASS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Ursus grisus. </p>
 <p> Stupid and shy, grass dwell under the beds of humans, stealing childrens‚Äô stuffed animals and hiding their pillows. They become furious when called ‚Äúbedbugs‚Äù, and this is why they bite. Their diet consists only of purple chocolate and hot sauce, although desperate grass will consume air. Purple chocolate is made from the cacao pods of the purple gem tree. Purple gem trees only grow in Panda Arm Island, so they are quite rare. Because purple chocolate is only available in Panada and hot sauce is mainly available in Pumaguay, most grass make their home somewhere between the two countries. Some grass live in Panada and will run up to 500 kilometres a day to get hot sauce from Pumaguay before returning home. Some grass live in Pumaguay and dash to Panada every day to get purple chocolate. As purple chocolate is a discontinued item and no longer manufactured by Nestle‚Ñ¢, grass are rapidly becoming extinct. However, many wildlife conservation efforts are being made in order to save this endangered creature. Grass are very wary of humans and dash away when they see them. (Since they have 6 legs, grass can reach speeds of 340 kph, or 110 mph) They also have camel brains and are often covered in fleas. A gris looks like this:</p>

 <h2>MITRZ</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Mit Mat </p>
 <p> This blob may not look like much, but it can merge with other species of its kind and turn into a monstrous thing. When it is large enough, it can also turn into a group of smaller mitrz. Mitrz, pronounced meetourz, are evil blobs. When a pink mitr is angry, it will turn fuchsia. Mitrz move by bouncing around, and a large mitr can encapsulate a person in its jelly-like body. This method of capturing prey is essential to a mitr'z survival. Some mitr, specifically the purple variety, have poison inside their stomachs, so that when they swallow their prey it will die swiftly. Pink mitrz, however, do not have that toxic substance in their bellies, so they can spit back up their prey and most times it will survive. Some mitrz do this to transport their prey to their habitats so that they can spit it back out and share it with their mitlets. </p>

 <h2>Pumaguay</h2>
 <p> Being the second largest country on the planet, Pumaguay has an area of about 7 million kilometres squared. As the name suggests, many pumas live in this country, along with lynxes, chickens, and many mitrz. Much of Pumaguay (about 1/3) is made up of desert. The largest desert is known by the Pumaguayans as the Sriracha Desert. The spicy peppers that grow there are essential to the hot sauce industry, and the hot sauce is an important food source for the grass bears. Not all of Pumaguay is made up of desert, though. There are also a variety of cordillera, forest, and prarie regions, as well as many large freshwater lakes. The two most important exports from Pumaguay are sriracha peppers and water.</p>
 <h2>Panada</h2>
 <p> Panada is one of the larger and more well-known countries in Jelopolous. With a land mass of 9.9 million square kilometres, it has many diverse landforms and a large population. In the northernmost areas of Panada dwell glorporges, haihgs, and buhnns, as well as many other species. However, the southern area of Jelopolous is where all the pandas live. Southern Panada attracts many visitors each year who love visiting the habitat of the adorable panda bears.</p>
 <p> Another major tourist attraction is Panda Arm Island. This island is warm and humid year-round, which allows the purple gem trees to thrive. Purple gem trees are very rare, even on Panda Arm Island, which is a problem for the grass population that depend on purple chocolate to survive. If you don't know what a purple gem tree is, a purple gem tree is a tree that grows dark, violet-coloured cacao pods. Chocolate manufacturers pick and roast these pods to produce purple chocolate, which is more magenta-coloured than violet-coloured once chocolatiers have added sugar and milk to it. These bars of goodness are the main food source for grass, which are green bears with six legs that dwell in Pumaguay and Panada.</p>   <p>Since there are so many different landforms in Panada, the country accomodates many species of plants and creatures. Northern Panada is a little chilly (although definitely not as chilly as Moosico) and quite dry, while southern Panada is extremely warm and sunny. Because of this, the land of Panada has a very high biodiversity and is able to host many exotic organisms. Panada has the highest number of zoos in all of Jelopolous, the most recent count totalling over 100 zoos.</p> 
 <h2>Moosico</h2>
 <p> Moosico is known for its bone-chilling temperatures and never-ending avalanches of snow. But not many people know that under all that snow and ice is a beautiful country filled with moose and a variety of other creatures that dwell in cold climates. The frigid land of Moosico has a bounty of fir trees, ice-capped mountains, and natural snowfroot plantations. Mountain goats, ice mitrz, and of course moose call this region home.</p>
 <p> The moose that live in this small, but peaceful area, are very friendly and sociable. These moose are unlike the species of moose that live on earth; they have adapted to cold weather and only the moose that can stand the -273.15 degree weather survive and breed to produce moose that thrive in this freezing climate. These moose also do not eat the same foods as moose on earth do. Many moose in Moosico depend on snowfroot, a crop only available to Moosicans, to survive. While moose on earth have a diet consisting of fruits, tree shoots, and seeds, moose on Jelopolous do not have those resources readily available and instead graze on one of the only plants able to survive in the harsh weather of Moosico.</p> 
 <p> What exactly is snowfroot? you may find yourself wondering. Well, snowfroot is a starchy, sweet vegetable, similar in appearance to a carrot, excepting the vibrant cyan colour it has. In fact, this bright, vibrant colour is so beautiful that some habitants of Moosico live there solely to harvest the dye that is used to colour many clothes and products in all of Jelopolous. This distinctive colour is only available from Moosico, so snowfroot dye is considered a very valuable resource that is in constantly in high demand. The taste of snowfroot is also phenomenal. Sadly, not many people in Jelopolous have tasted it, due to how expensive snowfroot is. According to native Moosicans, snowfroot has a "sweet, but not overwhelming taste. It has a crispy texture on the outside, and a softer, spongy texture on the inside. The inside tastes similar to vanilla sponge cake, and the outside tastes slightly caramelized, with a hint of strawberry flavour and notes of chocolate and mochi. It tastes good cold (which is how many Moosicans enjoy it, because of how expensive heating is in Moosico), but also tastes amazing warm, especially on a particularly cold day, when temperatures drop to the negative 300's."</p>
