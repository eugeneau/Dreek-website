 <hr><h1>CREATURES</h1>
 <h2>HAIHGS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Haihgo sapiens. </p>
 <p> With ash-gray skin and black, empty eyes, haihgs are quite frightening. It is said that the appearance of a haihg can make a grown man urinate his trousers in fear. Haihgs have long, bony talons, as well as fleshy, bulbous noses. They have puckered mouths with cracked, gray lips. The most well-known feature of a haihg, though, is its long, string, hair. Haihgs are nearly bald, save for a few of those thick, coarse hairs. They cascade down their bony shoulders and end with a comical curl. They are always hungry, and can consume up to 20 hippos per day. Despite gobbling up so much food daily, haihgs are extremely frail and lanky. Bones stick out of their elbows when they bend them, and their cheekbones are so sunken in that their eyes bulge, making them all the more frightening. Haihgs are also very clever and arrogant creatures. They are most proud of their hairy, broad feet, which are coated with grime and dust. They often boast of their feet to other haihgs.
      Below is a photo of an aggravated haihg.</p>

 <h2>POUS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Mus Ponchus </p>
   <p> That was really creepy! Now let me tell you about pous. Pous are a
      bear-hamster type creature that is very tiny. Commonly kept as pets, pous are relatively friendly and harmless. Most pous have short, brown fur, but there is a rare breed of pou called a golden pou that has long, curly, golden-brown fur. Golden pous are highly prized and it is estimated that only 350 golden pous reside in Jelopolous. The regular diet of a pou includes various seeds and fruits, as well as peanuts. However, the foods a pou desires most are black jelly beans and chili cheese dogs. Unfortunately for them, both of these foods are extremely unhealthy for them, so they can only have a small amount at a time. Pous are also very vocal and sociable animals, and when left alone for more than a few hours they start to squeal and shriek very loudly. These cries are so high pitched that they can shatter glass, and they are estimated to be as loud as 230 db.
 Pous are loud and yell, "POU, POU, POU!" when tickled. Here's a photo.</p>

 <h2>BUHNNS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Booga boogaga. </p>
 <p> Although they may look harmless, the colourful and box-like buhnn is a very aggressive creature. Trust me, they are sooooooo agressive. üò≤. At the bottom of the buhnn's cube body, a robust, purple spring made of keratin is attached. Buhnns are red in colour and have glowing yellow eyes. Male buhnns have long, razor-sharp, green horns adorning their boxy heads, and females have short, dull stubs. They attack their prey by stealthily bouncing up to them from behind and then leaping atop their heads,  crushing their bodies. The buhnn's diet consists mainly of red meat. They particularly enjoy steak. Buhnns consume their food by swallowing it whole. Here's a picture of a red buhnn.

 <h2 id="gris">GRASS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Ursus grisus. </p>
 <p> Stupid and shy, grises dwell under the beds of humans, stealing childrens‚Äô stuffed animals and hiding their pillows. They become furious when called ‚Äúbedbugs‚Äù, and this is why they bite. Their diet consists only of purple chocolate and hot sauce, although desperate grass will consume LA AIR. Purple chocolate is made from the cacao pods of the purple gem tree. Purple gem trees only grow in Panda Arm Island, so they are quite rare. As purple chocolate is a discontinued item and no longer manufactured by Nestle‚Ñ¢, grises are rapidly becoming extinct. However, many wildlife conservation efforts are being made in order to save this endangered creature. Grises are very wary of humans and dash away when they see them. (Since they have 6 legs, grises can reach speeds of 340 kph, or 110 mph) They also have camel brains and are often covered in fleas.

 <h2>FROUNNS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Clownus creepius </p>
 <p> Similar to clowns, frounns wear makeup and colourful costumes. Electric-blue curls frame their chubby, white faces. They are very jolly and have a loud, contagious laugh. Contrary to popular belief, frounns are actually very friendly and kind, handing out balloons to small children at their stands daily. Unfortunately, the children often do not accept the balloons and run away, screaming and crying. This is why frounns are quite poor and do not eat much, except for the foods that they get for free at the fair. As a result of this, the frounn often ingests a large amount of pink cotton candy and yellow popcorn every day, making them quite large and heavy. Legend has it that if you give a frounn green cotton candy, they will melt into the floor in horror and disintegrate. Frounns are also very talented at playing instruments such as drums, saxophone, trumpet and flute. </p>

 <h2 id="chumm">CHUMMS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Ichthyus friendlius. </p>
 <p> Known for their unicorn horns and friendly behavior, chumms are one of Jelopolous‚Äôs most loved fish. They have pale blue scales covering their 2 cm long bodies, but their bellies are covered with short, white fur. This fur protects them when they are swimming at the bottom of the vast ocean to look for plants to eat. Chumms love seaweed and algae, but are partial to cottage cheese, as well as honey cruller donuts. The unicorn horn on top of their heads allow them to swim to the surface and skewer donuts that fall into the ocean. It also shimmers when night falls and provides a small light source for the chumm if it needs it in the deep, dark ocean. </p>

 <h2>MITRZ</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Mit Mat </p>
 <p> This blob may not look like much, but it can merge with other species of its kind and turn into a monstrous thing. Mitrz, pronounced meetourz, are evil blobs. When the mitr is angry, it will turn fuchsia. Mitrz move by bouncing around, and a large mitr can encapsulate a person in its jelly-like body. This method of capturing prey is essential to a mitr'z survival. </p>

 <h2>MACCOS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Giantus Ronius. </p>
 <p> As their name suggests, these hefty giants will die for macaroni and cheese. Consuming so much of this fattening comfort food has caused many maccos to become morbidly obese, some weighing as much as 3000 pounds. A little-known fact about maccos is that they actually cannot smell. What many people assume to be a nose on this giant‚Äôs face is, in reality, only a thick flap of skin. This flap is made solely of fatty tissue, and if maccos were slim they would not have the flap, but skinny maccos do not exist. Maccos also have bad eyesight, considering that their beady eyes are about the size of peas. Since maccos have poor sight and no sense of smell, they have an especially strong sense of taste. Maccos are cheese connoisseurs, and if given Cap Dinner, they will ralph on it. </p>

 <h2>PUMAGUAY</h2>
  <p> Here is a map of Pumaguay. Pumaguay is a country in central Jelopolous and 
          has a mountainous cordillera in the central part. It is known by the Pumaguayans
          for the spicy srirachas in Sriracha Desert.</p>
         <img src="https://dreek16designer.com/Pumaguay.jpg" alt="Pumaguay"/>
  <p> Footspray contains a small city. Panada's "foot" broke off near the natural waterfall, 
             hence the name Footspray. Every year, green water sprays out of the waterfall at exactly 
             25:72 am every Catvember on the 33rd. Millions gather around the area, hopefully 
             watching and waiting for the green water to rise, but it never does, because Catvember 
             and the 33rd do not exist. Neither does 25:72 am. But you probably already knew that.
   <h2>PANADA</h2>
   <p> Anyway, you probably also have noticed that the "panda" that is Panada has a "Panda
             Arm Island". "Why is the arm detached from the body?" you may wonder. Well, legend
             has it that long, long ago, the inhabitants of Panada wanted a special place to vacation
             on. All of them were much too lazy to fly to Pumaguay or Moosico, so they just started
             creating a resort right in Panada. They filled what is now the island with a new village, 
             filled with shops, bamboo huts, and lots of other tourist attractions. But one day, there
             was an earthquake at the resort. Everyone was scared that their precious resort would
             be ruined, but by some chance, it was not. However the panda's "arm" was now no
             longer attached to the body! The inhabitants built a large bamboo cruise ship that would
             transport them to the resort, and the Panda Arm Island is now an even larger tourist
             attraction today.</p>
 <h2>MOOSICO</h2>
   <p> Moosico is a small country located in the north of Jelopolous. As the name 
             suggests, many moose live there. There are also ice-capped mountains and 
             evergreen trees everywhere, making it a beautiful area to have a cool 
             vacation in the mountains. The moose there are, for the most part, very
             friendly and sociable, but when shot with a gun, they attack you and kill
             you. Although there is a snow blanket covering the ground almost
             year-round, Moosicans have developed a special crop that can grow
             even in the coldest -273.15 C weather: the snowfroot. Snowfroot are often
             harvested for flavouring Froot Loops, or just for eating. The flavour
             of snowfroot is almost unimaginable - it tastes like strawberries with
             croissants, whipped cream (real, not that disgusting fake stuff) and caramel
             with chocolate and matcha pocky, as well as vanilla mochi. This interesting
             fruit is essential to a mooses' diet.<p/>
