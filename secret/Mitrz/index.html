 <h2>BUHNNS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Booga boogaga </p>
  <p>Height: 1.5 - 2 meters</p>
  <p>Weight: 80 - 100 kilograms</p>
  <p> Diet: Carnivorous - steak, pork, veal, occasionally humans</p>
  <p>Class: Metallum</p>
  <p>Behaviour: Aggressive</p>
 <p> Although they may look harmless, the colourful and box-like buhnn is a very aggressive creature. Trust me, they are sooooooo agressive. üò≤. At the bottom of the buhnn's cube body, a robust, purple spring made of keratin is attached. Buhnns are red in colour and have glowing yellow eyes. Male buhnns have long, razor-sharp, green horns adorning their boxy heads, and females have short, dull stubs. They attack their prey by stealthily bouncing up to them from behind and then leaping atop their heads,  crushing their bodies. The buhnn's diet consists mainly of red meat, and they consume this meat by swallowing it whole. They particularly enjoy steak. According to an ancient myth, there is one type of meat that a buhnn likes eating even more than red meat, and that is grey meat. This "grey meat" is, of course, the meat of a haihg. However, haihgs are extremely agile and much more efficient in a battle against a clumsy, bouncy buhnn. Therefore, it is very rare that a buhnn is able to kill a haihg, and many buhnns have since settled for red meat instead. A picture of a buhnn has been inserted below.</p>

 <h2>POUS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Mus Ponchus </p>
  <p> Height: 10 centimeters </p>
  <p> Weight: 30-40 grams </p>
  <p> Diet: Herbivorous - wild strawberries, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, peanuts, pine nuts </p>
  <p> Class: Mammal </p>
  <p> Behaviour: Passive </p>
 <p> Commonly kept as pets, pous are relatively friendly and harmless. Most pous have short, brown fur, but there is a rare breed of pou called a golden pou that has long, curly, golden-brown fur. Golden pous are highly prized and it is estimated that only 350 golden pous reside in Jelopolous. The regular diet of a pou includes various seeds and fruits, as well as peanuts. However, the foods a pou desires most are black jelly beans and chili cheese dogs. Unfortunately for them, both of these foods are extremely unhealthy for them, so they can only have a small amount at a time. Pous are also very vocal and sociable animals, and when left alone for more than a few hours they start to squeal and shriek very loudly. These cries are so high pitched that they can shatter glass, and they are estimated to be as loud as 230 db. Pous are loud and yell, "POU, POU, POU!" when tickled. Here's a photo.</p>

 <h2>HAIHGS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Haihgo sapiens </p>
  <p>Height: 2.8 - 3 meters</p>
  <p>Weight: 22 - 30 kilograms</p>
  <p>Diet: Carnivorous - hippos, children</p>
  <p>Class: Mammal</p>
  <p>Behaviour: Aggressive</p>
 <p> With ash-grey skin and black, empty eyes, haihgs are quite frightening. It is said that the appearance of a haihg can make a grown man urinate his trousers in fear. Haihgs have long, bony talons, as well as fleshy, bulbous noses. They have puckered mouths with cracked, grey lips. The most well-known feature of a haihg, though, is its long, string, hair. Haihgs are nearly bald, save for a few of those thick, coarse hairs. They cascade down their bony shoulders and end with a comical curl. They are always hungry, and can consume up to 20 hippos per day. Despite gobbling up so much food daily, haihgs are extremely gaunt and lanky. Bones stick out of their elbows when they bend them, and their cheekbones are so sunken in that their eyes bulge, making them all the more frightening. Whatever you do, do NOT be deceived by a haihg's frail appearance. A haihg is extremely strong relative to its bodyweight, and can even slaughter a buhnn if it tries. Haihgs are also very clever and arrogant creatures. They are most proud of their hairy, broad feet, which are coated with grime and dust. They often boast of their feet to other haihgs. However, nobody can actually see their feet, because they are always covered by the bottom of the haihg's cloak. Below is a photo of an aggravated haihg.</p>
 <center><img src="https://dreek16designer.com/Haihg2.png"></center>
 <h2>FROUNNS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Clownus creepius </p>
  <p>Height: 1.3 - 1.5 meters</p>
  <p>Weight: 60 - 70 kilograms</p>
  <p>Diet: Junkfoodius - pink cotton candy, popcorn, pretzels, lollipops, hot dogs, soda</p>
  <p>Class: Mammal</p>
  <p>Behaviour: Passive</p>
 <p> Similar to clowns, frounns wear makeup and colourful costumes. Electric-blue curls frame their chubby, white faces. They are very jolly and have a loud, contagious laugh. Contrary to popular belief, frounns are actually very friendly and kind, handing out balloons to small children at their stands daily. Unfortunately, the children often do not accept the balloons and run away, screaming and crying. This is why frounns are quite poor and do not eat much, except for the foods that they get for free at the fair. As a result of this, frounns often ingest a large amount of pink cotton candy and yellow popcorn every day, making them quite large and heavy. Legend has it that if you give a frounn green cotton candy, they will melt into the floor in horror and disintegrate. Frounns are also very talented at playing instruments such as drums, saxophone, trumpet and flute. </p>

 <h2 id="chumm">CHUMMS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Ichthyus friendlius </p>
  <p>Length: 5 - 7 centimeters</p>
  <p>Weight: 10 - 20 grams</p>
  <p>Diet: Herbivorous - seaweed, algae, honey cruller donuts, cottage cheese</p>
  <p>Class: Fish</p>
  <p>Behaviour: Passive</p>
 <p> Known for their unicorn horns and friendly behavior, chumms are one of Jelopolous‚Äôs most loved fish. They have pale blue scales covering their small bodies, and their bellies are covered with short, white fur. This fur protects them when they are swimming at the bottom of the vast ocean to look for plants to eat. Chumms love seaweed and algae, but are partial to cottage cheese, as well as honey cruller donuts. The unicorn horn on top of their heads allow them to swim to the surface and skewer donuts that fall into the ocean. It also shimmers when night falls and provides a small light source for the chumm if it needs it in the deep, dark ocean. </p>
 <center><img src="https://dreek16designer.com/Chummsmol.png" alt="Chumm"/></center>
 <h2>MACCOS</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Giantus Ronius </p>
 <p>Height: 2.8 - 3 meters</p>
  <p>Weight: 1200 - 1400 kilograms</p>
  <p>Diet: Macaroniandcheeseius - macaroni and cheese</p>
  <p>Class: Mammal</p>
  <p>Behaviour: Neutral</p>
  <h2>GRASS</h2>
  <p>Scientific name: Ursus grisus</p>
  <p>Length: 0.9 - 1.2 meters</p>
  <p>Weight: 24 - 26 kilograms</p>
  <p>Diet: Srirachachocolatus - hot sauce, purple chocolate, air</p>
  <p>Class: Mammal</p>
  <p>Behaviour: Neutral</p>
 <p> Stupid and shy, grass dwell under the beds of humans, stealing childrens‚Äô stuffed animals and hiding their pillows. They become furious when called ‚Äúbedbugs‚Äù, and this is why they bite. Their diet consists only of purple chocolate and hot sauce, although desperate grass will consume air. Purple chocolate is made from the cacao pods of the purple gem tree. Purple gem trees only grow in Panda Arm Island, so they are quite rare. Because purple chocolate is only available in Panada and hot sauce is mainly available in Pumaguay, most grass make their home somewhere between the two countries. Some grass live in Panada and will run up to 500 kilometres a day to get hot sauce from Pumaguay before returning home. Some grass live in Pumaguay and dash to Panada every day to get purple chocolate. As purple chocolate is a discontinued item and no longer manufactured by Nestle‚Ñ¢, grass are rapidly becoming extinct. However, many wildlife conservation efforts are being made in order to save this endangered creature. Grass are very wary of humans and dash away when they see them. (Since they have 6 legs, grass can reach speeds of 340 kph, or 110 mph) They also have camel brains and are often covered in fleas. A gris looks like this:</p>

 <h2>MITRZ</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Mit Mat </p>
  <p>Height: 10 centimeters - 0.8 mitrz</p>
  <p>Weight: 1 - 23 kilograms</p>
  <p>Diet: Omnivorous - humans, foraged debris</p>
  <p>Class: Gelata</p>
  <p>Behaviour: Aggressive</p>
 <p> This blob may not look like much, but it can merge with other species of its kind and tuDiet: Omnivorous - humans, foraged debrisn into a monstrous thing. When it is large enough, it can also turn into a group of smaller mitrz. Mitrz, pronounced meetourz, are evil blobs. When a pink mitr is angry, it will turn fuchsia. Mitrz move by bouncing around, and a large mitr can encapsulate a person in its jelly-like body. This method of capturing prey is essential to a mitr'z survival. Some mitr, specifically the purple variety, have poison inside their stomachs, so that when they swallow their prey it will die swiftly. Pink mitrz, however, do not have that toxic substance in their bellies, so they can spit back up their prey and most times it will survive. Some mitrz do this to transport their prey to their habitats so that they can spit it back out and share it with their mitlets. </p>
 <center><img src="https://dreek16designer.com/Mitr.png" alt="Mitr"/></center>
 <h2>NUHPPS</h2>
  <p>Scientific name: Canis nitrous</p>
  <p>Length: 30 - 50 centimeters</p>
  <p>Weight: 12 - 15 kilograms</p>
  <p>Diet: Carbonous - carbon dioxide</p>
  <p>Class: Metallum</p>
  <p>Behaviour: Neutral</p>
 <p> This wobbly, three-legged dog makes its home in the Sriracha desert. Its body resembling a can of soda, it stumbles to and fro, its metallic torso clanging with each step it takes. As you may already have guessed from the last two sentences, this creature is a very clumsy one. That isn't really its fault, though. It is very hard to walk properly when you're a dog that has three legs, and those three legs are all on the left side of your body. Another distinguishing feature of a nuhpp is their long, pointy chin. Not all nuhpps have chins of the same length, however. A nuhpp's chin grows just a fraction of a millimeter longer every time it falls over. Nuhpps with shorter chins are usually deemed "skilled" and "good with balance" in their world. Nuhpps with longer chins are often made fun of by other nuhpps. Like grass, nuhpps are also very shy, and will usually try to quickly stumble away whenever they see a human. </p>

 <h2>PEMMONS</h2>
  <p>Scientific name: Mus polypus</p>
  <p>Height: 1 - 1.2 meters</p>
  <p>Weight: 30 - 35 kilograms</p>
  <p>Diet: Herbivorous - lemons, melons, onions, potatoes</p>
  <p>Class: Mammal</p>
  <p>Behaviour: Neutral</p>
 <p> Is it a mouse? Is it an octopus? No, it's a pemmon! This unusual creature has bright orange skin, blue polka-dots, and huge, mouse-like ears. It has no limbs, but it does have long, curly tentacles on the bottom of its body. Pemmons are a generalist species, because they are able to live underwater and on land. This useful advantage makes up for their poor eyesight. Unfortunately, there is a 90% chance that when a pemmon is born, its eyes will be permanently sealed. The little vision that it does have is extremely blurred and limited in peripherality. Because of this, most pemmons will use their antennae to probe around rather than relying solely on their eyesight to find food and navigate their surroundings. The ten percent of pemmons that are born with good eyesight generally end up becoming the leaders of their glissades ("glissade" is the word meaning a group [of pemmons]). The lead pemmon will make clicking and hissing noises in order to guide its fellow pemmons through the vast lands of Jelopolous.</p>

 <h2>RELWUSSES</h2>
  <p>Scientific name: Scarabaeus clavas</p>
  <p>Length: 7 - 9 centimeters</p>
  <p>Weight: 20 - 25 grams</p>
  <p>Diet: Carnivorous - blood</p>
  <p>Class: Non-applicable; invertebrate</p>
  <p>Behaviour: Aggressive</p>
 <p>With a mace-like spiky tail and a love for curdled blood, this dark blue-green beetle is a dangerous one. Plates as strong as steel line its back, and its glowing red eyes can see in the dark. This is not a bug you want to mess with. Although just a beetle, the size of this creature is enormous. Large relwusses can grow to be the size of a mouse. This may not seem very large at first, until you remember that this thing is a bug. Relwusses live almost solely on curdled blood, as mentioned before. A relwuss kills its prey in two hits: it first whacks its opponent with the end of its tail to incapacitate it. Aferwards, the relwuss deals the final blow, causing the prey to bleed out. The relwuss then slurps up the blood with its primary mouth and jitters to its burrow, before regurgitating the blood and eating it with its secondary mouth. Disgusting. </p>

 <h2>KWYKIES</h2>
  <p>Scientific name: Rictum balloonus</p>
  <p>Length: 0.9 - 1 meter (excluding tail)</p>
  <p>Weight: 7 - 9 kilograms</p>
  <p>Diet: Herbivorous - seaweed</p>
  <p>Class: Amphibian</p>
  <p>Behaviour: Neutral</p>
 <p>A kwyky, pronounced "Gwee-ghee", is an underwater creature. Kwykies have yellow skin with a green stripe on their back and a green tail. However, kwykies are not usually known for their brightly coloured bodies. Instead, they are better known for their huge, red mouths and glowing red tail bulbs. The bulb on a kwyky's tail is bioluminescent, and lights up whenever a predator is approaching. This interesting strucural adaptation of the kwyky is very important to its survival. Kwykies also have black "filaments" on their heads. This filament, which is actually a sort of antennae, sends signals to the tail bulb. The green claws on each of the two front limbs of the kwyky allow it to dig its claws into the ground and float in its strange position (see picture of kwyky floating in position below) that it almost always is in. Since the kwyky's body is like a balloon and mostly filled with air, it will float to the surface and suffocate if it does not anchor its claws into the ocean floor.</p>
 <center><img src="https://dreek16designer.com/Kwyky.png" alt="Kwyky"/></center>
 <h2>GLORPORGES</h2>
  <p>Scientific name: Glorgus porgus</p>
  <p>Length: 2 - 2.2 meters</p>
  <p>Weight: 112 - 115 kilograms</p>
  <p>Diet: snowfroot</p>
  <p>Class: Bird</p>
  <p>Behaviour: Neutral</p>
 <p>You may have heard about this interesting flying creature in the Jelopolous Weekly, but do you actually know what it is? Well, you'll find out now. A glorporge is a pale yellow creature with wings. When most people think of glorporges, they often think of them with a flower on their head. But did you know that only male glorporges have this flower? The purpose of this flower is to attract females (mates). Glorporges are often sighted on rainy days, as the rainwater nourishes and grows the flower atop their head, and the larger a glorporge's flower is, the more attractive a mate usually finds him. Although glorporges have both wings and legs, they cannot walk. A glorporge is born with extremely floppy legs with no bones. Some stronger glorporges can use their legs to pick up things mid-flight, but most glorporges' legs are unfortunately useless, and their only purpose is to dangle in the air and flap in the wind behind them as they soar through the sky.</p>

 <h2>Pumaguay</h2>
 <p> Being the second largest country on the planet, Pumaguay has an area of about 7 million kilometres squared. As the name suggests, many pumas live in this country, along with lynxes, chickens, and many mitrz. Much of Pumaguay (about 1/3) is made up of desert. The largest desert is known by the Pumaguayans as the Sriracha Desert. The spicy peppers that grow there are essential to the hot sauce industry, and the hot sauce is an important food source for the grass bears. Not all of Pumaguay is made up of desert, though. There are also a variety of cordillera, forest, and prarie regions, as well as many large freshwater lakes. The two most important exports from Pumaguay are sriracha peppers and water.</p>
 <p> Pumaguay is the hottest country on the planet, and it isn‚Äôt just because of the sriracha peppers. Temperatures in this desertous country may climb to the 50s in the summertime. Fortunately, the more northern part is quite a bit cooler, the highest temperature usually being only about 30 degrees celsius. As a result, most inhabitants of Pumaguay choose to live in the northern area rather than the more southern area.</p>
 <h2>Panada</h2>
 <p> Panada is one of the smaller, but more well-known countries in Jelopolous. With a land mass of nearly 6 million square kilometres, it has many diverse landforms and a large population. In the northernmost areas of Panada dwell glorporges, haihgs, and buhnns, as well as many other species. However, the southern area of Jelopolous is where all the pandas live. Southern Panada attracts many visitors each year who love visiting the habitat of the adorable panda bears.</p>
 <p> Another major tourist attraction is Panda Arm Island. This island is warm and humid year-round, which allows the purple gem trees to thrive. Purple gem trees are very rare, even on Panda Arm Island, which is a problem for the grass population that depend on purple chocolate to survive. If you don't know what a purple gem tree is, a purple gem tree is a tree that grows dark, violet-coloured cacao pods. Chocolate manufacturers pick and roast these pods to produce purple chocolate, which is more magenta-coloured than violet-coloured once chocolatiers have added sugar and milk to it. These bars of goodness are the main food source for grass, which are green bears with six legs that dwell in Pumaguay and Panada.</p>   <p>Since there are so many different landforms in Panada, the country accomodates many species of plants and creatures. Northern Panada is a little chilly (although definitely not as chilly as Moosico) and quite dry, while southern Panada is extremely warm and sunny. Because of this, the land of Panada has a very high biodiversity and is able to host many exotic organisms. Panada has the highest number of zoos in all of Jelopolous, the most recent count totalling over 100 zoos.</p> 
 <h2>Moosico</h2>
 <p> Moosico is known for its bone-chilling temperatures and never-ending avalanches of snow. But not many people know that under all that snow and ice is a beautiful country filled with moose and a variety of other creatures that dwell in cold climates. The frigid land of Moosico has a bounty of fir trees, ice-capped mountains, and natural snowfroot plantations. Mountain goats, ice mitrz, and of course moose call this region home.</p>
 <p> The moose that live in this small, but peaceful area, are very friendly and sociable. These moose are unlike the species of moose that live on earth; they have adapted to cold weather and only the moose that can stand the -273.15 degree weather survive and breed to produce moose that thrive in this freezing climate. These moose also do not eat the same foods as moose on earth do. Many moose in Moosico depend on snowfroot, a crop only available to Moosicans, to survive. While moose on earth have a diet consisting of fruits, tree shoots, and seeds, moose on Jelopolous do not have those resources readily available and instead graze on one of the only plants able to survive in the harsh weather of Moosico.</p> 
 <p> What exactly is snowfroot? you may find yourself wondering. Well, snowfroot is a starchy, sweet vegetable, similar in appearance to a carrot, excepting the vibrant cyan colour it has. In fact, this bright, vibrant colour is so beautiful that some habitants of Moosico live there solely to harvest the dye that is used to colour many clothes and products in all of Jelopolous. This distinctive colour is only available from Moosico, so snowfroot dye is considered a very valuable resource that is in constantly in high demand. The taste of snowfroot is also phenomenal. Sadly, not many people in Jelopolous have tasted it, due to how expensive snowfroot is. According to native Moosicans, snowfroot has a "sweet, but not overwhelming taste. It has a crispy texture on the outside, and a softer, spongy texture on the inside. The inside tastes similar to vanilla sponge cake, and the outside tastes slightly caramelized, with a hint of strawberry flavour and notes of chocolate and mochi. It tastes good cold (which is how many Moosicans enjoy it, because of how expensive heating is in Moosico), but also tastes amazing warm, especially on a particularly cold day, when temperatures drop to the negative 300's."</p> 
 <h2>Aardmenia</h2>
 <p>Although it may be the least popular country on the planet, Aardmenia is a beautiful, but small archipelago filled with scenic mountains as well as large areas of forest. In fact, Aardmenia is said to produce up to 50 percent of Jelopolous‚Äôs wood! However, wood is not the only thing this country exports. It also plays a big role in the mining industry. Many metals and other ores can be found in this country that is rich in resources.</p>
 <p>There is also a lot of wildlife dwelling in Aardmenia, the two most bountiful creatures being aardvarks and termites. Perhaps the termites are the reason why this area is so unpopular with the tourists. However, citizens of Aardmenia state that the mountainous view and wide temperature range are worth seeing a couple of termites every once in a while. Luckily, the aardvark population does a good job of controlling the number of termites in the country. </p>
 <p>As previously stated above, the climate of Aardmenia is highly variable. Temperatures in this area seem to go to both extremes depending on the season, although the coldest temperature in Aardmenia is nowhere near what a native Moosican might consider cold.</p>
