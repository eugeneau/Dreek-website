 <h1>WELCOME</h1>
     <p> Welcome to Bung Pou Haihg! Have you ever experienced a weird jerking when you sit on your
       chair? Well, that's actually a Brobee shaking your chair while
       sleeping in the floor. Also, have you ever stood on a trampoline
       and then suddenly fell off? Well, that's strange. That shouldn't
       ever happen. When you slumber in your bug bed, do you ever feel
       TeRmItEs??? Well, that's bee-cuz they are termites! They might bug
       you a bit, but that's juuuuust bee-autiful!!! Um also haihgs are 
       pronounced hags, not HaAaIiIHhHhHhHGsssssss. Also...um
       nevermind! Keep reading the WEBPAGE to find out stuff!</p><br>
 <hr><h1>CREATURES</h1>
 <h2>HAIHGS</h2>
   <p> Scientific name: Haihgo sapiens.
With ash-gray skin and black, empty eyes, haihgs are quite frightening. It is said that the appearance of a haihg can make a grown man urinate his trousers in fear. Haihgs have long, bony talons, as well as fleshy, bulbous noses. They have puckered mouths with cracked, gray lips. The most well-known feature of a haihg, though, is its long, string, hair. Haihgs are nearly bald, save for a few of those thick, coarse hairs. They cascade down their bony shoulders and end with a comical curl. They are always hungry, and can consume up to 20 hippos per day. Despite gobbling up so much food daily, haihgs are extremely frail and lanky. Bones stick out of their elbows when they bend them, and their cheekbones are so sunken in that their eyes bulge, making them all the more frightening. Haihgs are also very clever and arrogant creatures. They are most proud of their hairy, broad feet, which are coated with grime and dust. They often boast of their feet to other haihgs.
      Below is a photo of an aggravated haihg.</p>

 <h2>POUS</h2>
   <p> That was really creepy! Now let me tell you about pous, scientific name: Mus Ponchus. Pous are a
      bear-hamster type creature that is very tiny. 
Commonly kept as pets, pous are relatively friendly and harmless. Most pous have short, brown fur, but there is a rare breed of pou called a golden pou that has long, curly, golden-brown fur. Golden pous are highly prized and it is estimated that only 350 golden pous reside in Planet. The regular diet of a pou includes various seeds and fruits, as well as peanuts. However, the foods a pou desires most are black jelly beans and chili cheese dogs. Unfortunately for them, both of these foods are extremely unhealthy for them, so they can only have a small amount at a time. Pous are also very vocal and sociable animals, and when left alone for more than a few hours they start to squeal and shriek very loudly. These cries are so high pitched that they can shatter glass, and they are estimated to be as loud as 230 db.
 Pous are
      loud and yell, "POU, POU, POU!" when tickled. Here's a photo.</p>
      <img src="https://dreek16designer.com/assets/Pouimproved.jpg" alt="Pou"/>
 <h2>BUNGS</h2>
   <p> Scientific name: Booga boogaga.
Although they may look harmless, the colourful and box-like bung is a very aggressive creature. Trust me, they are sooooooo agressive. üò≤. At the bottom of the bung's cube body, a robust, purple spring made of keratin is attached. Bungs are red in colour and have glowing yellow eyes. Male bungs have long, razor-sharp, green horns adorning their boxy heads, and females have short, dull stubs. They attack their prey by stealthily bouncing up to them from behind and then leaping atop their heads,  crushing their bodies. The bung's diet consists mainly of red meat. They particularly enjoy steak. Bungs consume their food by swallowing it whole. Here's a picture of a red bung.

 <h2>GRASS</h2>
  <p> Scientific name: Ursus grisus.
Stupid and shy, grises dwell under the beds of humans, stealing childrens‚Äô stuffed animals and hiding their pillows. They become furious when called ‚Äúbedbugs‚Äù, and this is why they bite. Their diet consists only of purple chocolate and hot sauce, although desperate grass will consume LA AIR. Purple chocolate is made from the cacao pods of the purple gem tree. Purple gem trees only grow in Panda Arm Island, so they are quite rare. As purple chocolate is a discontinued item and no longer manufactured by Nestle‚Ñ¢, grises are rapidly becoming extinct. However, many wildlife conservation efforts are being made in order to save this endangered creature. Grises are very wary of humans and dash away when they see them. (Since they have 6 legs, grises can reach speeds of 340 kph, or 110 mph) They also have camel brains and are often covered in fleas.
 A gris looks like this:</p>

 <h2>FROUNNS</h2>
 <p> Another creature residing in Jelopolous: Frounns!
Scientific name: Clownnus creepius.
Similar to clowns, frounns wear makeup and colourful costumes. Electric-blue curls frame their chubby, white faces. They are very jolly and have a loud, contagious laugh. Contrary to popular belief, frounns are actually very friendly and kind, handing out balloons to small children at their stands daily. Unfortunately, the children often do not accept the balloons and run away, screaming and crying. This is why frounns are quite poor and do not eat much, except for the foods that they get for free at the fair. As a result of this, the frounn often ingests a large amount of pink cotton candy and yellow popcorn every day, making them quite large and heavy. Legend has it that if you give a frounn green cotton candy, they will melt into the floor in horror and disintegrate. Frounns are also very talented at playing instruments such as drums, saxophone, trumpet and flute. </p>

 <h2>CHUMMS</h2>
  <p> And there is also a beautiful fish that lives in the sea, the Chumm. Scientific name: Ichthyus friendlius.
Known for their unicorn horns and friendly behavior, chumms are one of Planet‚Äôs most loved fish. They have pale blue scales covering their 2 cm long bodies, but their bellies are covered with short, white fur. This fur protects them when they are swimming at the bottom of the vast ocean to look for plants to eat. Chumms love seaweed and algae, but are partial to cottage cheese, as well as honey cruller donuts. The unicorn horn on top of their heads allow them to swim to the surface and skewer donuts that fall into the ocean. It also shimmers when night falls and provides a small light source for the chumm if it needs it in the deep, dark ocean. </p>

 <h2>MITRZ</h2>
 <p> Scientific name: Mit Mat </p>
 <p> This blob may not look like much, but it can merge with other species of its kind and turn into a monstrous thing. Mitrz, pronounced meetourz, are colour-changing blobs, kind of like chameleons. Mitrz change colour according to what they are touching. Unlike chameleons, their colour is the opposite of what the colour of the thing they are touching is. For example, when a mitr is standing on grass, its body will be a pink to a red colour. When the mitr is angry, it will turn fuchsia. Mitrz move by bouncing around, and a large mitr can encapsulate a person in its jelly-like body. This method of capturing prey is essential to a mitr'z survival. </p>
 <h2>MACCOS</h2>
   <p> 
Scientific name: Giantus Ronius.
As their name suggests, these hefty giants will die for macaroni and cheese. Consuming so much of this fattening comfort food has caused many maccos to become morbidly obese, some weighing as much as 3000 pounds. A little-known fact about maccos is that they actually cannot smell. What many people assume to be a nose on this giant‚Äôs face is, in reality, only a thick flap of skin. This flap is made solely of fatty tissue, and if maccos were slim they would not have the flap, but skinny maccos do not exist. Maccos also have bad eyesight, considering that their beady eyes are about the size of peas. Since maccos have poor sight and no sense of smell, they have an especially strong sense of taste. Maccos are cheese connoisseurs, and if given Cap Dinner, they will ralph on it. </p>

 <hr><h1>LOCATIONS</h1></hr>
 <h2>PUMAGUAY</h2>
  <p> Here is a map of Pumaguay. Pumaguay is a country in central bUnGpOuHaIhG and 
          has a mountainous cordillera in the central part. It is known by the Pumaguayans
          for the spicy srirachas in Sriracha Desert.</p>
         <img src="https://dreek16designer.com/Pumaguay.jpg" alt="Pumaguay"/>
  <p> Footspray contains a small city. Panada's "foot" broke off near the natural waterfall, 
             hence the name Footspray. Every year, green water sprays out of the waterfall at exactly 
             25:72 am every Catvember on the 33rd. Millions gather around the area, hopefully 
             watching and waiting for the green water to rise, but it never does, because Catvember 
             and the 33rd do not exist. Neither does 25:72 am. But you probably already knew that.
   <h2>PANADA</h2>
   <p> Anyway, you probably also have noticed that the "panda" that is Panada has a "Panda
             Arm Island". "Why is the arm detached from the body?" you may wonder. Well, legend
             has it that long, long ago, the inhabitants of Panada wanted a special place to vacation
             on. All of them were much too lazy to fly to Pumaguay or Moosico, so they just started
             creating a resort right in Panada. They filled what is now the island with a new village, 
             filled with shops, bamboo huts, and lots of other tourist attractions. But one day, there
             was an earthquake at the resort. Everyone was scared that their precious resort would
             be ruined, but by some chance, it was not. However the panda's "arm" was now no
             longer attached to the body! The inhabitants built a large bamboo cruise ship that would
             transport them to the resort, and the Panda Arm Island is now an even larger tourist
             attraction today.</p>
 <h2>MOOSICO</h2>
   <p> Moosico is a small country located in the north of BungPouHaihg. As the name 
             suggests, many moose live there. There are also ice-capped mountains and 
             evergreen trees everywhere, making it a beautiful area to have a cool 
             vacation in the mountains. The moose there are, for the most part, very
             friendly and sociable, but when shot with a gun, they attack you and kill
             you. Although there is a snow blanket covering the ground almost
             year-round, Moosicans have developed a special crop that can grow
             even in the coldest -273.15 C weather: the snowfroot. Snowfroot are often
             harvested for flavouring Froot Loops, or just for eating. The flavour
             of snowfroot is almost unimaginable - it tastes like strawberries with
             croissants, whipped cream (real, not that disgusting fake stuff) and caramel
             with chocolate and matcha pocky, as well as vanilla mochi. This interesting
             fruit is essential to a mooses' diet.<p/>
  <h2>THE TRAGIC TALE OF YERM ZILCH</h2>
<p>On Catvember the 33rd, at 25:72 am, a pougris was born. Now this was not an ordinary pougris ‚Äì in fact, pougrass are not ordinary at all ‚Äì but this was a purple pougris. His name was Yerm Zilch. Yerm's family was originally very poor and impoverished, but when they saw the cooing face of the violet pougris, they saw an opportunity to gain fame. Maybe even wealth. Their dreams were quickly destroyed when Yerm turned a year old. His once beautiful and luxurious hair was slowly turning more and more green. So Yerm's family started falling apart. His parents would fight, day and night. And his dad would always win, strangling his poor mother. You see, his father was a gris, and his mother was a pou. By some strange occurrence, the two had married and had a child ‚Äì a pougris.  
Every night, as Yerm lay in bed, he would hear the shouts and screams of his parents fighting. Tears trickled down his not-purple face as he listened to complaining and swearing.  
"It's all your fault your fur is green!" His mother would argue. "You made him turn green too! You ruined our chances of ever becoming famous!" 
"It's not like your fur is purple, either!" His father would bellow. "And it isn't my fault you married me! I have green fur, and everyone knows it!" 
"Well, I wish I never had married you!" His mother would shout back in a choked voice.  
When she said this, his father would simply go outrageous and try to strangle his mother until her face turned scarlet and she was sobbing for air. That was his warning to her: "Don't mess with me." 
Yerm worried for his family. He knew that sooner or later, they would get a divorce. And it was all his fault, just because he wasn't purple. So he devised a plan. He would dye his fur purple.  
So every day, just after his shower, Yerm applied a layer of purple FurDye to his green fur. But FurDye was not cheap, and the expenses were getting to be too much for Yerm, who got a dollar a week for allowance. His parents didn't fight as much, but they were getting a bit suspicious about how the purple hue was returning to his fur.  
When Yerm turned fourteen, he decided it was time for him to get a job. He looked far and wide for a job that would accept him, but none did. They thought that the purple colouring on his fur was from a contagious disease. When Yerm got turned down for the sixth time on account of his fur, he started contemplating giving up on the FurDye. But suddenly, a great idea came to mind... or so he thought. 
At the age of fourteen and three-quarters, Yerm started up his first MooTube channel. It quickly grew as billions of people were attracted to his unusual fur. Yerm was earning a good sum of money for a few months until one fateful day... 
As Yerm was about to head to his MooTube meet-and-greet, he noticed that his fur was fading a bit. Jumping behind a bush, he pulled a pocket-sized bottle of FurDye out and began applying it. A few moments later, he was interrupted by a policeman, looming over the bush. 
"And what do you think you're doing?" The policeman sneered. "Not as purple as they thought, are you?" 
"W-well..." Yerm stammered.  
Seeing no arguments, the policeman simply seized Yerm and took him to jail. When Yerm was told about his drastic decrease in subscribers on MooTube and his parents' divorce, he flatlined and was never seen again.</p> 
<div style="float: left;">
 <h2> EXPOSED! - The newspaper report (March first, 2020) </h2>
 <p> Zilch proved fraud by police. Yesterday night, the famous pougris Yerm Zilch, was siezed by officials. He was seen injecting FurDye‚Ñ¢ into his arm. For those of you who don't know, FurDye‚Ñ¢ is a chemical injected in the arm to temporarily turn fur a certain colour for a few weeks. After the police locked him up, Zilch admitted that he had been lying about his disease, purplecolorationsyndrome and he was sentenced to jail for life. Experts have seen a huge decline in Zilch's subscribers on Mootube. "They don't like me for who I am," Zilch wept histerically after being told the news.</p>
 <p> The security guard was said to have told him, "Yeah, nobody likes liars and frauds."</p>
 <p>After hearing this, Zilch flatlined and was never seen again.</p>
 <p> Thus concludes the tragic story of Yerm Zilch. Thanks for reading, see you next time, bye!!!</p>
