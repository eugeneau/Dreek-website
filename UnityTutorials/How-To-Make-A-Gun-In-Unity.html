<h1>How to Make a Gun in Unity 2019.3.9f1</h1>
<h2>Let's Get Started!</h2>
<p>1. Start by making a gun 3d model, then import it into Unity. Import the standard assets and drag and drop the player controller into the scene, or make your own player FPS controller. If you are making a shooter game, put the gun model as a child of the player camera.</p>
<p>2. Make a bullet prefab: for the sake of this tutorial, make a sphere, resize it appropriately and reset the Transform component. Drag and drop the object from your hierarchy into the project window to make a prefab. You can now delete the bullet from the scene. Make sure to save your changes (CTRL + S).</p>
<p>3. Add a collider to the bullet prefab and add a rigidbody (gravity is optional, this will change depending on the mass value). Add a new script called Bullet: <a href="Bullet.cs">Bullet.cs</a>
</p>
<p>4. Let's start making our gun. Select the gun model we mad earlier.</p>
<p>5. Add a new script to our gun object. You will need a shoot sound effect and a muzzle flash particle system: <a href="Gun.cs">Gun.cs</a><br>
<p>As you can see if you clicked on the gun script, we have a firepoint transform. this will be an empty GameObject in the gun's muzzle (where we want to shoot out). Make sure the Z axis faces forward.</p>
<p>6. Assign everything in the inspector appropriately.</p>  
<p>7. Design a quick level and playtest your game. Congrats!!! You've completed this tutorial! You can add any modifications you like to this. </p>
