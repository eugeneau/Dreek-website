<h2 style="float: center">BREAKING NEWS! New creatures spotted in PumaPolis! (Sunday, April 5th, 2020)</h2>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, researcher Dreep Lounspandi set out to search for a snowfroot plantation. On the way, in PumaPolis, he spotted something shiny hiding in a zarrberry bush. As he snuck closer to find out what it was, a metallic, 3-legged dog-like creature dashed out of the bush. Unfortunately, as soon as the shy animal spotted the curious researcher, it jumped back and disappeared into the foliage. Researcher Dreep is soon going to attempt to find more information on this matter. We will update you when he notifies us. Thanks for reading the Jelopolous Weekly, and stay tuned for updates on the researcher's finds. </p>

<h2 style="float: center">Beloved Researcher Locked in Haihg House! (Sunday, April 12th, 2020)</h2>
<p>This morning, Pickles, the friend of the famous researcher Dreep, came banging on the doors of the Jelopolous Weekly News Station. Pickles had received what seemed like a ransom note for her friend Dreep. Pickles reported to us that the day before, researcher Dreep had gone exploring for a creature that he called a "pemmon". Pickles had been worried sick last night when Dreep had still not yet returned. But this morning, Pickles was shocked to find a ransom note on her window sill. The note was written in crooked script, and it was mysteriously signed "The Haihgs". Pickles stated that "I do not know who these haihgs are, or what they have done to my brother. I am going on a search and will not give up until I beat up those haihgs and they never bully my fwiend again!" This is Jelopolous Weekly. Thanks for watching, and stay tuned on the story. </p>

<h2 style="float: center">Researcher Dreep Rescued! (Sunday, April 26th, 2020)</h2>
<p>If you remember the story where Dreep got captured by the haihgs, you're going to like this one. After Pickles asked for help from some pemmons (the creatures Dreep was going to go investigate the day he got kidnapped) she set off in search of the nearest haihg house. As they approached, Pickles noticed that the haihgs weren't home. Then she remembered that today was the buhnn dance, and all the haihgs had gone to the festival. Pickles nervously approached the door. When she was inside, she finally saw her friend hanging above a bubbling cauldron. Cutting the ropes loose, she swept up her friend and they returned home, unharmed. Mission accomplished! Thanks for reading the Jelopolous Weekly. Please come back next week for more updates on what's trending in Panada, all the way to Pumaguay.</p>

<h2 style="float: center">Glorporge Sighted in Purple Gem Tree! (Sunday, May 17th, 2020)</h2>
<p>A few days ago, a villager residing on Panda Arm Island claimed to have seen a glorporge. What is a glorporge, you may ask? Well, if you live on Panda Arm Island, you probably wouldn't know, because glorporges are not native to the warm, humid climate of the beautiful island. A glorporge is a pale yellow creature with a long, sensitive nose and small, beady eyes. Male glorporges often have a small flower growing on their head (the purpose of this flower is to attract females). However, glorporges only live in the more northern parts of Jelopolous. Many glorporges dwell in Moosico and in the surrounding area, but rarely are they seen anywhere else. This is why it was such a surprise when somebody called in to report a glorporge sighting. The glorporge seems to have been sitting in a purple gem tree, gnawing away at the violet-coloured cacao pods. Many people were attracted to the adorable actions of the glorporge and gathered round to meet the first glorporge ever to set foot in Panda Arm Island. Researcher Dreep, who apparently had become very fond of the new creature, even named the glorporge "Nosey" after his long nose. How the creature even came to the island remains a mystery, but many villagers seem to be happy little Nosey has come to their island. Thanks for reading Jelopolous Weekly, and we hope to see you next Sunday!</p>

<h2 style="float: center">Hot Sauce Car Crashes into Hot Sauce Store! (Sunday, May 24th, 2020)</h2>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a strange event occured. A gris who had just gotten his liscence was carelessly driving around in his new hot sauce car, when suddenly he drifted off the road and rolled over a curb, flying into the McHaihg shopping centre's plaza. As the terrified gris continued rolling down the ashphalt in his very cylindrical vehicle, he panicked and crashed into a hot sauce store. The impact caused his brand-new car to explode, leaving hot sauce everywhere and streaking the walls of the store in thick red-orange sauce. Surprisingly, the gris was unharmed, but his liscence was taken away anyway. Thanks for reading the Jelopolous Weekly. We hope you come again next time!</p>

<h2 style="float: center">Chumm Fossil Found Under Layers of Desert Sand! (Sunday, May 31, 2020)</h2>
<p>Around three months ago, when construction workers were digging the foundation for the new PetDumb in the Sriracha Desert, a mysterious fossil was found. Although the fossil was uncovered in the scorching, dry Sriracha Desert, the fossil looked like - a fish. After Researcher Dreep studied the strange fossil for a while, he discovered that the fossil was actually a chumm, estimated to be around 250 years old. This crazy discovery has led to people making astounding theories about the Sriracha Desert. Was the famously dry desert originally filled with a body of water? Scientists and researchers are racing to find out. Thanks for reading the Jelopolous Weekly newspaper. See you soon!</p>

<h2 style="float: center">Potato Car Stolen From PotatoesRUs! (Sunday, June 7th, 2020)</h2>
<p>Early this morning, at about 4 am, a potato car was stolen from the nearby PotatoesRUs in PumaPolis. Video evidence showed a figure dressed in black clothing and a mask driving away with one of Mr. Spud's precious potato cars. However, the car seemed to be too slow and the masked figure soon gave up and ran away. Mr. Spud, the owner of PotatoesRUs, had this to say:</p> <p>"Each of my potato cars are hand crafted by myself. If that dirty burglar had managed to drive away with my precious vehicle, you don't even want to know what would happen. Thank goodness my beautiful potato is safe and sound!"</p> <p>It seems the slowness and inefficiency of the potato car worked against the robber and provided an advantage for Mr. Spud after all. Anyway, thanks for reading Jelopolous Weekly. See you next week on Sunday!</p>

<h2 style="float: center">25-Year-Old Cappuccino Found in Kim Norton's Refrigerator! (Sunday, June 14th, 2020)</h2>
<p>The other day, a Kim Norton's employee was looking through the fridge for the jug of milk when he came across a very ancient cup of coffee. Apparently, the mug was one of the previous manager's retirement party gifts. Another employee recalled that the old manager had made an enormous cappuccino to celebrate, and somehow left it in the fridge for over two decades. After finding the rather disgusting beverage, the disturbed employee threw it out, and it was never to be seen again. Thanks for reading the Jelopolous Weekly! Bye!</p>

<h2 style="float: center">Priceless Mona Grisa Stolen from Mooseum! (Sunday, June 21st, 2020)</h2>
<p>During the wee hours of 2 am this morning, a precious painting, the Mona Grisa, was snatched from the Moosico Mooseum. Museum workers were shocked to find that the area where the beautiful painting once hung was empty. Upon close inspection of the camera footage, two masked men were seen carrying the painting out the door and loading it into their truck. Investigation is still underway, and hopefully these thieves will soon be caught. Thank you for reading the Jelopolous Weekly.</p>

<h2 style="float: center">Mona Grisa Found and Returned to Mooseum! (Sunday, June 28th, 2020)</h2>
<p>Last week, you may have heard that the famous Mona Grisa was stolen. Well, today we are happy to report that the prized painting is safe and sound and back in the place where it belongs. The day after the two thieves had stolen the painting, police caught a glimpse of a masked man unloading a large painting from the back of his truck and lugging it into his house. Police soon seized him, and he and his companion were thrown into jail for a 10 years sentence. All of the museum members are relieved that their precious painting is back in the museum. Thanks for reading the Jelopolous Weekly, and we hope to see you soon!</p>

<h2 style="float: center">Pou Trapped in Sack of Potatoes! (Sunday, July 5th, 2020)</h2>
<p>A few days ago, a resident of Pumaguay was making cheesy potato gratin when he heard a muffled squealing noise from his bag of potatoes. Supposing it to be from a mouse, the man tore open the sack of potatoes to find a pou, crying and lost among the russets. Apparently the man was so startled that he dropped his knife and tried to hide behind the counter, but after a few moments he stood back up and started to stroke the frightened pou. The pou, which was named Poutato after the incident, was handed over to Researcher Dreep for examination. I think we are all relieved that little Poutato is safe and sound in Researcher Dreep's home. Thanks for reading the Jelopolous Weekly, and have a nice day!</p>

<h2 style="float: center">Boy Trapped in Herd of Grass! (Sunday, July 12th, 2020)</h2>
<p>Yesterday in the late afternoon, a young boy was wandering around in a prarie when he suddenly heard the sound of a gris running toward him. Startled, he fell on the ground, astounded. Then, without warning, more and more grass started surrounding him, circling the child. The boy, realizing that his purple chocolate granola bar was attracting the usually shy creatures, threw it towards them and they eventually left him alone. After the incident, the boy had this to say:</p>
<p>"I had no choice, so I had to throw my granola bar at them. That was supposed to be my snack for today!"</p>
<p>We're lucky the boy got home safe and sound. It was all due to his quick thinking and good knowledge of the gris. Thanks for reading the Jelopolous Weekly. We hope to see you soon!</p>
