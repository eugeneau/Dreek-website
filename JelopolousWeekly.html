<h2>BREAKING NEWS! New creatures spotted in PumaPolis! (Sunday, April 5th, 2020)</h2>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, researcher Dreep Lounspandi set out to search for a snowfroot plantation. On the way, in PumaPolis, he spotted a something shiny hiding in a zarberry bush. As he snuck closer to find out what it was, a metallic, 3-legged dog-like creature dashed out of the bush. Unfortunately, as soon as the shy animal spotted the curious researcher, it jumped back and disappeared into the foliage. Researcher Dreep is soon going to attempt to find more information on this matter. We will update you when he notifies us. Thanks for reading the Jelopolous Weekly, and stay tuned for updates on the researcher's finds. </p>
