<h2>BREAKING NEWS! New creatures spotted in PumaPolis! (Sunday, April 5th, 2020)</h2>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, researcher Dreep Lounspandi set out to search for a snowfroot plantation. On the way, in PumaPolis, he spotted something shiny hiding in a zarrberry bush. As he snuck closer to find out what it was, a metallic, 3-legged dog-like creature dashed out of the bush. Unfortunately, as soon as the shy animal spotted the curious researcher, it jumped back and disappeared into the foliage. Researcher Dreep is soon going to attempt to find more information on this matter. We will update you when he notifies us. Thanks for reading the Jelopolous Weekly, and stay tuned for updates on the researcher's finds. </p>

<h2>Beloved Researcher Locked in Haihg House! (Thursday, April 16th, 2020)</h2>
<p>This morning, Pickles, the friend of the famous researcher Dreep, came banging on the doors of the Jelopolous Weekly News Station. Pickles had received what seemed like a ransom note for her friend Dreep. Pickles reported to us that the day before, researcher Dreep had gone exploring for a creature that he called a "pemmon". Pickles had been worried sick last night when Dreep had still not yet returned. But this morning, Pickles was shocked to find a ransom note on her window sill. The note was written in crooked script, and it was mysteriously signed "The Haihgs". Pickles stated that "I do not know who these haihgs are, or what they have done to my brother. I am going on a search and will not give up until I beat up those haihgs and they never bully my fwiend again!" This is Jelopolous Weekly. Thanks for watching, and stay tuned on the story. </p>

<h2>Researcher Dreep Rescued! (Monday, May 11th, 2020)</h2>
<p>If you remember the story where Dreep got captured by the haihgs, you're going to like this one. After Pickles asked for help from some pemmons (the creatures Dreep was going to go investigate the day he got kidnapped) she set off in search of the nearest haihg house. As they approached, Pickles noticed that the haihgs weren't home. Then she remembered that today was the buhnn dance, and all the haihgs had gone to the festival. Pickles nervously approached the door. When she was inside, she finally saw her friend hanging above a bubbling cauldron. Cutting the ropes loose, she swept up her friend and they returned home, unharmed. Mission accomplished! Thanks for reading the Jelopolous Weekly. Please come back next week for more updates on what's trending in Panada, all the way to Pumaguay.</p>
