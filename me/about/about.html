<title>ABOUT</title>
<h1>About</h1>
<p> I am a Christian Minecrafter, & I love making addons in my spare time.
  I want to share the good news of Jesus with you guys, so I am planning
   on making a Minecraft Bible addon.</p>
<p> Once upon a time, a lonely grain of rice was eaten. Now this was a horrible mistake. This grain of rice was much too special to be eaten by the lowly peasant Drake. The lowly peasant gobbled the morsel without a second thought. The rice, however, had ten thoughts. </p> 

<p> 1) Your breath stinks. </p>

<p> 2) Your breath will stink no longer because rice doesn’t stink. </p>

<p> 3) Why did you eat me? </p>

<p> 4) You stink. </p>

<p> 5) I don’t. </p>

<p> 6) You forgot to eat my friend. </p>

<p> 7) I hate your mouth. </p>

<p> 8) Your teeth are sharp. </p>

<p> 9) I’m about to die. </p>

<p> 10) I died. </p>

<p> As the rice breathed its last and travelled down into the peasant’s stomach, Drake started to cry. He realized he had murdered an innocent grain of rice. So right then and there, he decided to become vegan. But then he realized that rice was vegan. So right then and there, he decided to become airan. All he would eat was air from now on. Happily gulping down air, he started his journey of being airan. </p> 

<p> Two days later, Drake felt dreadfully ill. He had not had any water since two days ago, and he was dying of dehydration. He also felt extremely hungry. His stomach was practically eating itself. </p>

<p> A day later, Drake died of dehydration. </p>

<p> A week later, when Drake had come back to life, he decided that he would never be airan again. He would not even be vegan. He would be rican, and only eat rice for the rest of his life. Unfortunately, the rest of his life was very short. </p>

<p> A few weeks later, Drake died of lack of protein and essential nutrients. </p>

<p> Another week later, when Drake had come back to life again, he decided that he would never be rican again. He would not even be airan or vegan. He would be allfoodian, and he started his journey of being allfoodian right then and there. Happily gulping down veggies, meat, and couscous, he did not regret his decision. Not one bit. So Drake grew up to be a happy strong boi who was sooooo healthy. THEEEEE END. </p>
