    <p> Welcome to Bung Pou Haihg! Have you ever experienced a weird jerking when you sit on your
       chair? Well, that's actually a Brobee shaking your chair while
       sleeping in the floor. Also, have you ever stood on a trampoline
       and then suddenly fell off? Well, that's strange. That shouldn't
       ever happen. When you slumber in your bug bed, do you ever feel
       TeRmItEs??? Well, that's bee-cuz they are termites! They might bug
       you a bit, but that's juuuuust bee-autiful!!! Um also haihgs are 
       pronounced hags, not HaAaIiIHhHhHhHGsssssss. Also...um
       nevermind! Keep reading the WEBSITE to find out stuff!</p>
   <p> Okay. We're talking haihgs! A haihg is like a witch that devours rats, 
      children and pous. Despite eating so much food, they are extremely
      skinny and frail. Haihgs have long fangs and stringy hair, as well
      as razor-sharp talons. They often dress in long, dark dresses or 
      cloaks and never wear shoes. Although haihgs possess bony,
      crooked feet with warts, they are proud of their feet, and leave 
      them exposed. However, some cloaks are so long that they 
      cover the haihgs' feet completely, like in the picture below.
      Below is a photo of an aggravated haihg.</p>

   <p> That was really creepy! Now let me tell you about pous. Pous are a
      bear-hamster type creature that is very tiny. They enjoy ingesting chili 
      cheese dogs and consuming black licorice-flavoured jelly beans, although
      both of these foodstuffs are not particularly healthy for them. Pous are
      loud and yell, "POU, POU, POU!" when tickled. Here's a photo.</p>

   <p> Bungs. Bungs are like a bouncy box on a spring and are soooooo aggresive. 
      They sometimes attack humans and pous. They have glowing yellow eyes and
       long green horns. Bungs attack by bouncing up to their enemies and springing 
       on top of their heads, crushing their skulls and severing their heads.</p>

  <p> Here is a map of Pumaguay. Pumaguay is a country in central bUnGpOuHaIhG and 
          has a mountainous cordillera in the central part. It is known by the Pumaguayans
          for the spicy srirachas in Sriracha Desert.</p>

  <p> Footspray contains a small city. Panada's "foot" broke off near the natural waterfall, 
             hence the name Footspray. Every year, green water sprays out of the waterfall at exactly 
             25:72 am every Catvember on the 33rd. Millions gather around the area, hopefully 
             watching and waiting for the green water to rise, but it never does, because Catvember 
             and the 33rd do not exist. Neither does 25:72 am. But you probably already knew that.
   <p> Anyway, you probably also have noticed that the "panda" that is Panada has a "Panda
             Arm Island". "Why is the arm detached from the body?" you may wonder. Well, legend
             has it that long, long ago, the inhabitants of Panada wanted a special place to vacation
             on. All of them were much too lazy to fly to Pumaguay or Moosico, so they just started
             creating a resort right in Panada. They filled what is now the island with a new village, 
             filled with shops, bamboo huts, and lots of other tourist attractions. But one day, there
             was an earthquake at the resort. Everyone was scared that their precious resort would
             be ruined, but by some chance, it was not. However the panda's "arm" was now no
             longer attached to the body! The inhabitants built a large bamboo cruise ship that would
             transport them to the resort, and the Panda Arm Island is now an even larger tourist
             attraction today. Here is a photo taken in space of Panada:</p>

   <p> Moosico is a small country located in the north of BungPouHaihg. As the name 
             suggests, many moose live there. There are also ice-capped mountains and 
             evergreen trees everywhere, making it a beautiful area to have a cool 
             vacation in the mountains. The moose there are, for the most part, very
             friendly and sociable, but when shot with a gun, they attack you and kill
             you. Although there is a snow blanket covering the ground almost
             year-round, Moosicans have developed a special crop that can grow
             even in the coldest -273.15 C weather: the snowfroot. Snowfroot are often
             harvested for flavouring Froot Loops, or just for eating. The flavour
             of snowfroot is almost unimaginable - it tastes like strawberries with
             croissants, whipped cream (real, not that disgusting fake stuff) and caramel
             with chocolate and matcha pocky, as well as vanilla mochi. This interesting
             fruit is essential to a mooses' diet.<p/>
